To see the effect frame size has on different replacement policies. Learn how to do
simulation of cache performance. Use the simulator to compare the hit ratio for cache
with different block sizes and replacement strategies. The report describing the results of
FIFO and LRU replacement policy simulations for various numbers of possible
addresses, and frame sizes.

=>>  Cache memory is a chip-based computer component that makes retrieving data from
the computer&#39;s memory more efficient. It acts as a temporary storage area that the
computer&#39;s processor can retrieve data from easily. This temporary storage area, known as a
cache , is more readily available to the processor than the computer&#39;s main memory source,
typically some form of DRAM .

=>>  Cache memory is sometimes called CPU (central processing unit) memory because it is
typically integrated directly into the CPU chip or placed on a separate chip that has a
separate bus interconnect with the CPU. Therefore, it is more accessible to the processor,
and able to increase efficiency, because it&#39;s physically close to the processor.
